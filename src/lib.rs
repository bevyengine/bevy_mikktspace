//! Provides a byte-identical implementation of [`mikktspace`] in entirely safe
//! and idiomatic Rust.
//! This is used to generate [`TangentSpace`] values for 3D geometry.
//! Like the original implementation, this crate has no dependencies.
//!
//! With _only_ the default features enabled, this should produce _identical_
//! results to [`mikktspace`] on x86 architectures.
//! Other architectures may produce differing results due to the original
//! implementation's reliance on undefined behavior.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! As a preliminary step for `no_std` users, you must provide an implementation
//! for [`Ops`].
//! When the `std` feature is enabled, one is provided and automatically selected
//! as the default.
//!
//! First, implement [`MikkTSpaceInterface`] for your geometry.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! impl MikkTSpaceInterface for MyGeometry { /* ... */ }
//! ```
//!
//! The interface is how this crate reads geometric information _and_ writes back
//! the generated tangent space information.
//!
//! Finally, use [`generate_tangent_space`] to calculate and write back all
//! [`TangentSpace`] values.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The code is designed to consistently generate the same tangent spaces, for a
//! given mesh, in any tool in which it is used.
//! This is done by performing an internal welding step and subsequently an
//! order-independent evaluation of tangent space for meshes consisting of
//! triangles and quads.
//! This means faces can be received in any order and the same is true for the
//! order of vertices of each face.
//! The generated result will not be affected by such reordering.
//! Additionally, whether degenerate (vertices or texture coordinates) primitives
//! are present or not will not affect the generated results either.
//!
//! Once tangent space calculation is done the vertices of degenerate primitives
//! will simply inherit tangent space from neighboring non degenerate primitives.
//! The analysis behind this implementation can be found in Morten S. Mikkelsen's
//! master's [thesis].
//!
//! Note that though the tangent spaces at the vertices are generated in an
//! order-independent way, by this implementation, the interpolated tangent space
//! is still affected by which diagonal is chosen to split each quad.
//! A sensible solution is to have your tools pipeline always split quads by the
//! shortest diagonal.
//! This choice is order-independent and works with mirroring.
//! If these have the same length then compare the diagonals defined by the
//! texture coordinates.
//! [XNormal], which is a tool for baking normal maps, allows you to write your
//! own tangent space plugin and also quad triangulator plugin.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! ## `std` (default)
//!
//! Provides access to the standard library, allowing a default implementation
//! of [`Ops`] to be provided.
//! If you disable this feature, you will need to provide a type implementing
//! [`Ops`] as the `O` parameter in the [`MikkTSpaceInterface`] trait.
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy_mikktspace::{Geometry, Ops};
//! # struct MyOps;
//! # struct MyGeometry;
//! impl Ops for MyOps {
//!     fn sqrt(x: f32) -> f32 {
//!         unimplemented!()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn acos(x: f32) -> f32 {
//!         unimplemented!()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # #[cfg(any())]
//! impl Geometry<MyOps> for MyGeometry { /* ... */ }
//! ```
//!
//! A common backend for implementing [`Ops`] is [`libm`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy_mikktspace::Ops;
//! # struct LibmOps;
//! impl Ops for LibmOps {
//!     fn sqrt(x: f32) -> f32 {
//!         libm::sqrtf(x)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn acos(x: f32) -> f32 {
//!         libm::acos(x as f64) as f32
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that alternate backends _may_ break byte-compatibility with the original
//! C implementation.
//! It also should go without saying that improper implementations could give
//! entirely incorrect results.
//!
//! ## `corrected-edge-sorting`
//!
//! Fixes a known bug in the original C implementation which can affect the
//! generated values.
//! The bug can cause edges to be improperly sorted, leading neighboring faces
//! to be ungrouped.
//! If you do not need byte compatibility with the C implementation, it is
//! recommended to enable this feature for improved performance, compile times,
//! and correctness.
//!
//! ## `corrected-vertex-welding`
//!
//! Fixes a known bug in the original C implementation which can affect the
//! generated values.
//! This bug causes vertices to be combined in such a way that the lowest vertex
//! index isn't reliably selected.
//! If you do not need byte compatibility with the C implementation, it is
//! recommended to enable this feature for improved performance, compile times,
//! and correctness.

//! # Advice
//!
//! To avoid visual errors (distortions/unwanted hard edges in lighting), when
//! using sampled normal maps, the normal map sampler must use the exact inverse
//! of the pixel shader transformation.
//! The most efficient transformation we can possibly do in the pixel shader is
//! achieved by using, directly, the "unnormalized" interpolated tangent, bitangent
//! and vertex normal: `vT`, `vB` and `vN`.
//!
//! ```c, ignore
//! // pixel shader (fast transform out)
//! vNout = normalize(vNt.x * vT + vNt.y * vB + vNt.z * vN);
//! ```
//!
//! where `vNt` is the tangent space normal.
//!
//! The normal map sampler must likewise use the interpolated and "unnormalized"
//! tangent, bitangent and vertex normal to be compliant with the pixel shader.
//!
//! ```c, ignore
//! // sampler does (exact inverse of pixel shader):
//! float3 row0 = cross(vB, vN);
//! float3 row1 = cross(vN, vT);
//! float3 row2 = cross(vT, vB);
//! float fSign = dot(vT, row0)<0 ? -1 : 1;
//! vNt = normalize(fSign * float3(dot(vNout,row0), dot(vNout,row1), dot(vNout,row2)));
//! ```
//!
//! where `vNout` is the sampled normal in some chosen 3D space.
//!
//! Should you choose to reconstruct the bitangent in the pixel shader instead of
//! the vertex shader, as explained earlier, then be sure to do this in the normal
//! map sampler also.
//!
//! Finally, beware of quad triangulations.
//! If the normal map sampler doesn't use the same triangulation of quads as your
//! renderer then problems will occur since the interpolated tangent spaces will
//! differ even though the vertex level tangent spaces match.
//! This can be solved either by triangulating before sampling/exporting or by
//! using the order-independent choice of diagonal for splitting quads suggested earlier.
//! However, this must be used both by the sampler and your tools/rendering pipeline.
