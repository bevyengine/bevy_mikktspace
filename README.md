This is a rewrite of the [Mikkelsen Tangent Space Algorithm reference implementation](https://archive.blender.org/wiki/2015/index.php/Dev:Shading/Tangent_Space_Normal_Maps/) in Rust. It is loosely based on [`mikktspace`](https://github.com/gltf-rs/mikktspace), an existing port, except `bevy_mikktspace` has:
- exact **byte-for-byte output equivalence** with the original C source under all conditions[^1].
- fully idiomatic rust with **no unsafe** code, to support building in no-unsafe contexts.
- **no dependencies**, to avoid needing perpetual dependency-version-bump releases in the future.

Requires at least Rust 1.85.1.

## Examples

### cube_tangents

Demonstrates generating tangents for a cube with 4 triangular faces per side.

```sh
cargo run --example cube_tangents
```

## Features

The original reference implementation has a couple bugs,
which are largely inconsequential in most practical applications.
However, fixing them would mean diverging from exact output equivalence,
so `bevy_mikktspace` offers features to control this behavior:

- `corrected-edge-sorting`:
  Correct a comparison in the reference's edge quicksort implementation.
  This can only differ on the last triangle in a model.
- `corrected-vertex-welding`:
  Guarantees the smallest-index vertex is chosen when welding.
  This differs from the reference on NaN vertices.

[^1]: Extensive fuzz-testing against the reference implementation revealed divergence in NaN handling in [https://github.com/gltf-rs/mikktspace](https://github.com/gltf-rs/mikktspace), which is *probably* inconsequential for practical uses.
